Case Study: AI-Powered Restaurant Booking Automation
### 1. Introduction

Crown Street Food, a local restaurant in Lillington, faced challenges with manual booking management. Staff were spending significant time handling calls, managing double-bookings, and confirming reservations manually.

To solve this, I built an AI-powered booking assistant using:

- Vapi (Voice AI Assistant)

- Make.com (automation & integration)

- Google Calendar (single source of truth for reservations)

- Gmail (customer confirmations)

### 2. Problem Statement

- Manual calls â†’ prone to human error

- No centralized booking system â†’ double-bookings possible

- Time-consuming for staff to confirm or cancel bookings

- Customers lacked instant confirmation

### 3. Solution Overview

- I designed a CRUD-based booking automation workflow:

* Create â†’ AI captures booking request â†’ Webhook â†’ Calendar event created â†’ Confirmation email sent

* Read â†’ AI checks existing bookings in Calendar â†’ returns availability

* Update â†’ Customer requests change â†’ AI finds event by Booking ID or name+time â†’ updates details â†’ sends confirmation

* Delete â†’ Customer cancels â†’ AI finds event â†’ deletes â†’ sends cancellation email

### 4. Workflow Architecture

* Vapi AI â†’ Collects booking details from customer (name, guests, date, time, email).

* Webhook to Make.com â†’ Routes request into automation.

* Router in Make.com â†’ Directs request to Create / Read / Update / Delete branch.

* Google Calendar Module â†’ Stores and manages events.

* Gmail Module â†’ Sends booking confirmation or cancellation email.

* Webhook Response â†’ Returns AI confirmation message instantly.

### 5. Business Impact

- Reduced booking errors by ensuring Google Calendar is the source of truth.

- Improved customer satisfaction with instant confirmations.

- Freed up staff from manual call management.

- Scalable to SMS/WhatsApp reminders in the future.

### 6. Future Enhancements

- SMS reminders (via Twilio or Vonage).

- Daily summary email to restaurant staff with upcoming reservations.

- Loyalty tracking (frequent diners, special offers).

- Multi-language support for diverse customer base.

### 7. Key Learnings

- Importance of router + filters in Make.com to separate CRUD operations.

- Handling Booking ID vs Search Event for updates/deletions.

- Best practices for exposing automation projects on GitHub (document, donâ€™t expose live webhooks).
